Guide to using C++ development enviroment on Mac with Subllime Text Editor.

Things to Remember :-

	1. Sublime Text is your text editor that you will use to write code.

	2. Your compiler (Clang C++ Compiler) is already installed on your system. On Windows or Linux platform you will find "GNU or GCC C/C++ Compiler".

	You will not find any difference in their usage. 

	3. To run ( Compile and Execute ) your program, simply press
	"Command + B".


Setting Up your Sublime text :-

	Although you can write code and press "Command + B" to get output on the terminal at the bottom of the screen. But it is recommended to use two different files for giving input and getting output from the program.

	Let your input file is "input.txt" and output file as "output.txt". 

		Note : You can give any name to these files but .txt is must.

	To make use of this method of interaction with your program you need to include these two lines in the beginning of your "main" function.

	freopen("INPUT_FILE_NAME", "r", stdin);
	freopen("OUTPUT_FILE_NAME", "w", stdout);

Steps to simultaneously open 3 windows ( Code, input, output):-
	1. Open Sublime Text Editor.
	2. Go to Files in top navigatin bar of Sublime and choose Open.
	3. Navigate to the folders where your files are located or where you want to write code.
	4. Make sure your input.txt and output.txt are present in the same folder where you are writing code.
